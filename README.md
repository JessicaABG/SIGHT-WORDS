### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 

-how to generate random words: and use random words to query the database/make api call. 

*--simple interface*
*--basic words for kids*
*--progress card*
*--replaces learned words with new words*


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---
|08.28.21|WKE| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes 
|08.31.21|MON| Project Approval 
|08.31.21|MON| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) 
|09.01.21|TUE| Pseudocode / actual code 
|09.01.21|WED| Initial Clickable Model 
|09.02.21|THU| MVP 
|09.03.21|FRI| Presentations 
## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component------------ | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --------------------- | 	:---:  |	  :---: 	|	:---:	    | 	:---:     |
| Structure/Template 	| L | 2H| -- | -- |
| Working with API 		| L	| 2H| -- | -- |
| Javascript			| H |10H| -- | -- |
| CSS					| H	| 6H| -- | -- |
| HTML					| H	|2/H| -- | -- |
| Total 				| H |22h| -- | -- |
